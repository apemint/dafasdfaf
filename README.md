# Password Generator

Press the button, answer the prompts, and get a randomly generated password. Copy the password to your clipboard to use else where.

## Description

A password generator designed so that when the user clicks the generate password button, the user is prompted with their desired password length, and which types of charcters (special, uppercase, lowercase, numeric) to include. Once the app has the user's choices, it creates an array of viable character usable in the password, and then in a loop, randomly chooses characters in the viable array and pushes them into a new array until the specified password length is met. It the converts the new array with our password characters into a string so that we remove any commas, making it easily copy-and-paste-able. The new password string is then shown on the page for the user.

### Executing the app

Just click the button.
